# Classical Painting

Description:

A page where you can draw different things. You can use different colors (there's a rainbow event too), erase, delete and change the number of pixels. 

I had a lot fun creating this small project. I used a lot of new things, such as input[type = 'range'], input[type = 'color'], mouse events and a lot more.
